## Manual

---

The Etch-a-Sketch program is a web-based application that allows users to draw on a grid using different colors. Here's a summary of its functionality:

1. The program creates a 16x16 grid of square elements on the webpage.

2. Users can choose a color using a color picker.

3. By hovering over the squares on the grid, users can draw by setting the background color of the square to the chosen color.

4. Clicking on the grid disables the drawing mode to prevent accidental drawing.

5. The program provides an erase button to clear a particular sqaure and a reset button that clears the grid by resetting the background color of all squares.

6. Additionally, there is an RGB mode button that enables random color generation. In this mode, hovering over squares applies random RGB colors to the grid.

7. Users can switch between the color picker and RGB modes to create different effects on the grid.
