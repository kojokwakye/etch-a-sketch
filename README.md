# etch-a-sketch

a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an etch-a-sketch.

## [live](https://kojokwakye.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)

### broke a few rules whiles building this

1.  instead of a 16 x 16 grid, i went for double that size.

2.  assignment asked us to have a prompt that asks the user to input the size of grid they want but i found out that the `#container` behaves weirdly for whatever reason (i'll figure it out later)
