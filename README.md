# [ETCH-A-SKETCH ](https://kojokwakye.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)

A browser version of something between a sketchpad and an etch-a-sketch.  
this program allows users to draw on the grid using a chosen color or random RGB colors, as well as erasing and resetting the drawing when needed.

## MANUAL

The Etch-a-Sketch program is a browser application that allows users to draw on a grid using different colors. Here's a summary of its functionality:

1. The program creates a 16x16 grid of square elements on the webpage.

2. Users can choose a color using the color picker or use the default black pencil.

3. By hovering over the squares on the grid, users can draw by setting the background color of the square to the chosen color.

4. Click once on the grid disables drawing mode to prevent accidental drawing. I guess there's nothing like an "accident" when it comes to an etch-a-sketch.

5. Additionally, there is an RGB mode button that enables random color generation. In this mode, hovering over squares applies random RGB colors to the grid.

6. The program provides a restart button that clears the grid by refreshing the page.

7. Users can switch between the color picker and RGB modes to create different effects on the grid.
